### Hi, lovely you <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50"></h2>

Today I think myself a programmer/creator who:

- 🏫 Graduated from Nanjing University
- 💃 Working as a SDE at Wechat Pay
- 🐟 Interested in Go, C++ and distributed system
- 🌱 Owner of [PUSH TO KINDLE!](https://github.com/Aneureka/push-to-kindle) and [ANIMATE ME!](https://github.com/Aneureka/animate-me)
- 🎮 Loving ACG and exploring fancy techs, playing `Super Mario Odyssey` and `Brawl Stars` these days

Catch me out of this week:
